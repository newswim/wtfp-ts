ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

Learning about FP-TS can be a challenge. What even is it?

1. It's an \_implementation of a higher-kinded type system in a language that doesn't naturally support one (TypeScript).
2. It's a collection of "typeclasses" or "modules" which are typically supported by languages that also support HKTs.
3. It's a collection of helper functions which operate on the typeclasses, in adition to more generalized helpers like `pipe`.

### Learning Resources

It used to be pretty difficult to get started with FP-TS, but now there are some really good resources available:

1. https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/learning-resources
2. https://github.com/enricopolanski/functional-programming
3. https://fp-training-app.now.sh
4. https://grossbart.github.io/fp-ts-recipes

And maybe this one, eventually.

### What is the repo?

I wanted to give an introduction on Monads, within the context of FP-TS.

Check that out in `/src/monad/presentation.md`, as well as the other files in that folder.
