## The "essence" of Monad

A reasonable intuition is that a "monad" can be represented by the triple:

    monad = [endofunctor, naturalTransformationOne, naturalTransformationTwo]

### What is an endofunctor?

```
Functor {
  map: a -> b -> f a -> f b
}
```

```
Endofunctor {
  map: a -> a -> f a -> f a
}
```

is `toString()` an endofunctor?

```
toString: nonNull -> string
```

### What are the natural transformations?

They're whatever the natural transformations are for that endofunctor... :)

> In practice, we represent these going "up" or "down" a heirarchy of endofunctors.

```
Up == "return" (of/pure for Applicative)
Down == "bind" (flatten/chain for Chain)
```

### The "Maybe" monad

- In a world of effectful programs, we may want to represent a notion of "failure"

The essence of "Maybe"

```ts
if (isNothing(fa)) {
  return nothing
}
```
